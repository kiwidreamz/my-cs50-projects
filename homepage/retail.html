        <h1>Retail Investors</h1>
        </div>

        <p>A retail investor, also known as an individual investor, is a <b>non-professional</b> investor who buys and sells securities or funds. They generally invest smaller amounts than larger, institutional investors.</p>

        <p>The retail revolution has been made possible by the internet, which had a few main impacts on retail investing :</p>

        <h4>Evolution of Communication</h4>

        <p>Prior to the Internet, the retail investor's best bet was to head to the local library to read financial literature, and research companies and securities such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.</p>

        <h4>From Lower Fees to Zero Commissions</h4>

        <p>The other primary benefit that the Internet has had on investing is the effect it has on lowering fees for investors.
        In particular, retail investors have seen a dramatic decline in the commission rates they pay to trade securities.<br>
        It has become an industry standard to offer no comission-trading, which was made successfully implemented by the company Robinhood.</p>

        <h4>Going Viral</h4>

        <p>The third wave is the confluence of social-media and viral events in the stock market.
        Never in history have we ever had young people excited and talking about stocks, market performance, and portfolios.<br>
        There are countless videos on social media platforms YouTube and TikTok explaining the ins and outs of what happened with stocks such as <i>GameStop</i> and <i>AMC</i>.</p>
