        <h1>The Retail Investing Revolution</h1>
        </div>

        <p>In the opaque and fiercely protected world of finance, information is and has always been the opium on which investors have thrived and amassed their fortunes.</p>

        <p>Access to early information, high frequency trading, front running etc. provided disproportionate and unfair advantage to <a href="institutional.html" target="_blank"> Institutional Investors</a> compared to a highly fragmented and diverse base of <a href="retail.html" target="_blank">Retail Investors</a>.</p>

        <p>There has been a real revolution in recent years when it comes to investing, where individual retail investors started actively participating in the stock market in growing numbers.
        The boom in retail investing has come after individuals were given considerable power thanks to the internet, in the form of readily available and easily accessible information, the advent of zero-comission trading, and the virality of social media.<br></p>

        <p>Furthermore, this revolution has coincided with pandemic lockdowns, as people were suddenly stuck at home with lots of time on their hands, no sports to watch or bet on and no where to go spend their money.
        On top of that, the Federal Reserve response to the pandemic was to drop interest rates to 0, which made people reluctant to keep their money in savings account. The combination of all these factors has culminated in a massive boom in retail trading.</p>
